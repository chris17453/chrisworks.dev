# ChrisWorks.dev - Data-Driven Portfolio Template

## üöÄ About This Project

This is my (Chris Watkins) personal portfolio and "hire me" website, built as a **fully data-driven template** that anyone can use. While it showcases my 25 years of experience in IT and engineering, the entire architecture is designed so you can clone it, update the data files, and have your own professional portfolio running in minutes.

**Live Site**: [https://chrisworks.dev](https://chrisworks.dev)

## üéØ Why This Exists

I needed a portfolio site to showcase my work and help me find my next role. But instead of building a one-off site, I created a completely data-driven template system. Now you can use the same professional design for your own career journey - just update the data files with your information!

## ‚ú® Features

- **100% Data-Driven**: Every piece of text comes from configuration files
- **Zero Component Editing Required**: Just edit JSON-like data files
- **Professional Design**: Clean, modern, responsive layout
- **SEO Optimized**: Meta tags, structured data, all configurable
- **Section Control**: Enable/disable sections as needed
- **Terminal Animations**: Cool retro terminal effects (optional)
- **Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes, professional appearance
- **MIT Licensed**: Free to use for any purpose

## üèÉ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chris17453/chrisworks.dev.git
cd chrisworks.dev
npm install
```

### 2. Make It Yours

Edit these files in `src/data/`:

#### `site_data.js` - Main Configuration
```javascript
personal: {
  full_name: 'Your Name',
  email_user: 'you',
  email_domain: 'yourdomain.com',
  phone: '(555) 123-4567',
  location: 'Your City, State',
  years_experience: 10
}
```

#### `experience.js` - Your Work History
```javascript
export const professional_experience = [
  {
    title: "Your Title",
    company: "Your Company",
    date: "2020 - Present",
    description: "What you did...",
  }
];
```

#### `projects.js` - Your Projects
```javascript
projects: [
  {
    name: "Your Project",
    description: "What it does",
    url: "https://github.com/you/project",
    tech: ["React", "Node.js"],
  }
]
```

#### `skills.js` - Your Skills
```javascript
skills: [
  { name: "JavaScript", level: 4, description: "Frontend & Backend" },
  { name: "Python", level: 3.5, description: "Automation & ML" }
]
```

### 3. Add Your Images

Replace in `/public/static/`:
- `chris.webp` ‚Üí your profile photo
- `og.png` ‚Üí your social media preview image

### 4. Run It

```bash
npm start  # Development
npm run build  # Production build
```

## üìÅ What to Edit (and What Not to)

### ‚úÖ DO Edit These:
```
src/data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ site_data.js       # All your personal info & content

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects.js        # Your projects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skills.js          # Your technical skills
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hobbies.js         # Your side projects/hobbies

public/static/         # Your images
```

### ‚ùå DON'T Edit These (unless customizing the template itself):
```
src/components/        # Template components (already perfect!)
src/styles/           # Styling (unless you want different colors)
src/App.js           # Main app logic
```
